## Overview

We now know how to develop reproducible analyses on small scale using serial workflows.

In this lesson we shall learn how to scale-up for real life work, which requires using paraller
workflows.

## Workflows as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG)

The computational analyses can be expressed as a set of steps where some steps depends on other
steps before they can begin their computations.  In other words, the computational steps as
expressed as Directed Acyclic Graphs, for example:

The REANA platform supports several DAG workflow specification languages:

- [Common Workflow Language (CWL)](https://www.commonwl.org/) originated in life sciences
- [Yadage](https://yadage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) originated in particle physics

In this lesson we shall use the Yadage workflow specification language.

## Yadage

Yadage enables to describe complex computational workflows. Let us start having a look at the Yadage specification for the RooFit example we have used in the beginning episodes:

```yaml
stages:
  - name: gendata
    dependencies: [init]
    scheduler:
      scheduler_type: 'singlestep-stage'
      parameters:
        events: {step: init, output: events}
        gendata: {step: init, output: gendata}
        outfilename: '{workdir}/data.root'
      step:
        process:
          process_type: 'interpolated-script-cmd'
          script: root -b -q '{gendata}({events},"{outfilename}")'
        publisher:
          publisher_type: 'frompar-pub'
          outputmap:
            data: outfilename
        environment:
          environment_type: 'docker-encapsulated'
          image: 'reanahub/reana-env-root6'
          imagetag: '6.18.04'
  - name: fitdata
    dependencies: [gendata]
    scheduler:
      scheduler_type: 'singlestep-stage'
      parameters:
        fitdata: {step: init, output: fitdata}
        data: {step: gendata, output: data}
        outfile: '{workdir}/plot.png'
      step:
        process:
          process_type: 'interpolated-script-cmd'
          script: root -b -q '{fitdata}("{data}","{outfile}")'
        publisher:
          publisher_type: 'frompar-pub'
          outputmap:
            plot: outfile
        environment:
          environment_type: 'docker-encapsulated'
          image: 'reanahub/reana-env-root6'
          imagetag: '6.18.04'
```


We can see that the workflow consists of two steps, ``gendata`` does not depending on anything
(``[init]``) and ``fitdata`` depending on ``gendata``.  This is how linear workflows are expressed
in the Yadage language.

## Running Yadage workflows

Let us write the above workflow as ``workflow.yaml`` in the RooFit example directory.

How can we run the example on REANA platform?  We have to instruct REANA that we are going to use
Yadage as our workflow engine.  We can do that by editing ``reana.yaml`` and specifying:

```yaml
version: 0.6.0
inputs:
  parameters:
    events: 20000
    gendata: code/gendata.C
    fitdata: code/fitdata.C
workflow:
  type: yadage
  file: workflow.yaml
outputs:
  files:
    - fitdata/plot.png
```

We now can run this example on REANA in the usual way:

```bash
$ reana-client run -w roofityadage -f reana-yadage.yaml
```

> ## Exercise

> ## Solution
>
> Nothing changes in the usual user interaction with the REANA platform:
>
> ```bash
> $ reana-client create -w roofityadage -f ./reana-yadage.yaml
> $ reana-client upload ./code -w roofityadage
> $ reana-client start -w roofityadage
> $ reana-client status -w roofityadage
> $ reana-client logs -w roofityadage
> $ reana-client ls -w roofityadage
> $ reana-client download plot.png -w roofityadage
> ```

## Physics code vs orchestration code

Note that it wasn't necessary to change anything in our code: we simply modified the workflow
definition and we could run the RooFit code "as is" using another workflow engine.  This is a simple
demonstration of the separation of concerns between "physics code" and "orchestration code".

## Parallelism via step dependencies

We have seen how serial workflows can be also expressed in Yadage syntax using step dependencies.
Note that if dependency graph would have permitted, the workflow steps not depending on each other
or on the results of previous computations could have been executed in parallel by the workflow
engine -- the physicist _only_ has to supply knoweldge about which steps depend on which other steps
and the workflow engine takes care about efficiently starting and scheduling tasks.

## HiggsToTauTau analysis: simple version

Let us demonstrate how to write simple Yadage workflow for the HiggsToTauTau analysis using simple
step dependencies.

The workflow looks like:

```yaml
stages:
- name: skim
  dependencies: [init]
  scheduler:
    scheduler_type: singlestep-stage
    parameters:
      input_dir: {step: init, output: input_dir}
      output_dir: '{workdir}/output'
    step: {$ref: 'steps.yaml#/skim'}

- name: histogram
  dependencies: [skim]
  scheduler:
    scheduler_type: singlestep-stage
    parameters:
      input_dir: {step: skim, output: skimmed_dir}
      output_dir: '{workdir}/output'
    step: {$ref: 'steps.yaml#/histogram'}

- name: fit
  dependencies: [histogram]
  scheduler:
    scheduler_type: singlestep-stage
    parameters:
      histogram_file: {step: histogram, output: histogram_file}
      output_dir: '{workdir}/output'
    step: {$ref: 'steps.yaml#/fit'}

- name: plot
  dependencies: [histogram]
  scheduler:
    scheduler_type: singlestep-stage
    parameters:
      histogram_file: {step: histogram, output: histogram_file}
      output_dir: '{workdir}/output'
    step: {$ref: 'steps.yaml#/plot'}
```

where steps are expressed as:

```yaml
skim:
  process:
    process_type: 'interpolated-script-cmd'
    script: |
      mkdir {output_dir}
      bash skim.sh {input_dir} {output_dir}
  environment:
    environment_type: 'docker-encapsulated'
    image: gitlab-registry.cern.ch/awesome-workshop/awesome-analysis-eventselection-stage3
    imagetag: master
  publisher:
    publisher_type: interpolated-pub
    publish:
      skimmed_dir: '{output_dir}'

histogram:
  process:
    process_type: 'interpolated-script-cmd'
    script: |
      mkdir {output_dir}
      bash histograms_with_custom_output_location.sh {input_dir} {output_dir}
  environment:
    environment_type: 'docker-encapsulated'
    image: gitlab-registry.cern.ch/awesome-workshop/awesome-analysis-eventselection-stage3
    imagetag: master
  publisher:
    publisher_type: interpolated-pub
    publish:
      histogram_file: '{output_dir}/histograms.root'

plot:
  process:
    process_type: 'interpolated-script-cmd'
    script: |
      mkdir {output_dir}
      bash plot.sh {histogram_file} {output_dir}
  environment:
    environment_type: 'docker-encapsulated'
    image: gitlab-registry.cern.ch/awesome-workshop/awesome-analysis-eventselection-stage3
    imagetag: master
  publisher:
    publisher_type: interpolated-pub
    publish:
      datamc_plots: '{output_dir}'

fit:
  process:
    process_type: 'interpolated-script-cmd'
    script: |
      mkdir {output_dir}
      bash fit.sh {histogram_file} {output_dir}
  environment:
    environment_type: 'docker-encapsulated'
    image: gitlab-registry.cern.ch/awesome-workshop/awesome-analysis-statistics-stage3
    imagetag: master
  publisher:
    publisher_type: interpolated-pub
    publish:
      fitting_plot: '{output_dir}/fit.png'
```

The workflow definition is similar to that of the Serial workflow, and, as we can see, it can
already lead to certain parallelism, because the fitting step and the plotting step can run
simultaneously once the histograms are produced.

The graphical representation of the workflow is:

Let us try to run it on REANA cloud.

## Parallelism via scatter-gather paradigm

A useful paradigm of workflow languages is a "scatter-gather" behaviour where we instruct the
workflow engine to run a certain step over a certain input array in parallel as if each element of
the input were a single item input (the "scatter" operation). The partial results processed in
parallel are then assembled together (the "gather" operation). The "scatter-gather" paradigm allows
to express "map-reduce" operations with a minimal of syntax without having to duplicate workflow
code or statements.

Here is an example of scatter-gather paradim in the Yadage language:

<img src="{{ page.root }}/fig/yadage_multi_cascading_map_reduce.png" width="800px" />

expressed as:

```yaml
stages:
  - name: map
    dependencies: [init]
    scheduler:
      scheduler_type: multistep-stage
      parameters:
        input: {stages: init, output: input, unwrap: true}
      batchsize: 3
      scatter:
        method: zip
        parameters: [input]
  - name: map2
    dependencies: [map]
    scheduler:
      scheduler_type: multistep-stage
      parameters:
        input: {stages: map, output: outputA, unwrap: true}
      batchsize: 2
      scatter: ...
  - name: reduce
    dependencies: [map2]
    scheduler:
      scheduler_type: singlestep-stage
      parameters:
        input: {stages: 'map2', output: outputA}
```

Note the "scatter" happening over "input" with a wanted batch size.

In the next episode we shall see how the scatter paradigm can be used to speed up the HiggsToTauTau
workflow using more parallelism.
