## Wrapping up

We have discussed the problem of reproducibility and reusability of scientific analyses.

We have practiced the declarative programming approach through several examples of containerised
scientific workflows.

We have seen some of the capabilities of the [REANA](http://www.reana.io) platform allowing
you to easily run containerised scientific workflows on remote compute clouds.

Please experiment with the containerised scientific workflows and let us know what you think!

The REANA platform is in a pilot stage; the early feedback with real-life use cases is
greatly appreciated.

Thanks and here's to many preproducible analyses ;)
